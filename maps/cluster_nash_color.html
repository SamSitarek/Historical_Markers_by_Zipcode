In 1908, May incorporated the company under a new name—May Hosiery Mills—and opened a new location next to the Louisville & Nashville railroad terminal on Brown St. in South Nashville. Jacob ran the mill with the help of his sons, Mortimer and Dan, until his death in 1946.   In the early 20th century, the mill was among the largest employers in Nashville. It employed many Jewish refugees the May family helped flee Nazi Germany in the 1930s. For much of the mill's 88 years, its hundreds of employees, mostly women, manufactured a million socks a week. The factory supplied major department stores nationwide and made the socks worn by the NASA Apollo 11 crew. The mill ceased operations in 1985 and has since served as space for artists and businesses.")</div>`)[0];

Merry, born enslaved in 1824 in Kentucky, was brought to Tennessee by his master. At age 16, his widowed mistress willed him to the First Baptist Church. He was freed in 1845. Merry preached to the 'colored' mission of First Baptist, which was established in 1843. When it became 'First Colored Baptist Church' (now First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill) in 1865, Merry, an ordained minister, was named pastor. The Rev. Merry is buried in Mt. Ararat Cemetery.")</div>`)[0];
